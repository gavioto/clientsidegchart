<h1>The GChart Manifest</h1> 

<p>
Jack Welch had Six Sigma.  George Bush had his "vision thing".
And an animated sponge has his "This is going to be the best day
ever!".  So forgive me for enunciating GChart's fundamental
principles in this grandiose "GChart Manifest" (and no, I did not
forget the "o").
</p>

<p>
I'd like to say these principles guided me in every step of
GChart's design and implementation. In fact, after many attempts
at something better, I ended up choosing the only strategy I was
actually able to code, and then came up with the these principles
to rationalize what I'd done (a statistical justification is
planned for the next version).
</p>

<ul>

<b><li> 99<small><small><small><sup>44</sup>/<sub>100</sub></small></small></small>% Pure GWT Java</li></b>

<p>
   Why leave the GWT-Java sandbox just to add a few charts?
</p>

<p>
   Want to trace into your chart library in the Eclipse IDE and
   tweak a line that isn't working the way you want it to? GChart
   gives you this level of complete, Java-based, source-level,
   control.
</p>

<p>
   And, because it's layered on GWT's standard library, your
   deployed application is fully optimized by GWT's compiler,
   and compatibility with all GWT-supported browsers is
   practically automatic.
</p>


 <b><li>Square is Beautiful&trade;</li></b>

<p>
   OK, I admit it: our simple "just say it with rectangles"
   implementation strategy often leaves us no choice but to
   forget the flashy eye candy and embrace our inner squareness.
</p>

<p>
   So, we aim for charts that clearly communicate the meaning of
   a data set in, say, an engineering or scientific application. We
   scorn 3-D pie charts with perfectly manicured edges.  Instead we
   ask: "Why insist on solid fill pie slices when banded-fill uses 
   a fraction of the HTML elements?"
</p>

<p>
   Square is simple and fast and works even in IE6 quirks-mode.
   Or, in the words of SpongeBarSquareCharts (no relation), "This is
   going to be the boxiest chart ever!"
</p>

 <b><li>Client-side Charts are a Good Thing</li></b>

<p>
  Sure, you can generate great charts from a server. Indeed, with
the new Google Chart API, you can even generate them for free off
of someone else's servers. But if you need off-line charting, or
simply prefer that your application's performance be constrained by
the client computer, not by the connection and server, you need a
client-side GWT charting solution.  
</p>

<b><li> Intelligibly Open; Cost-Effectively Free. </li></b>

<p>
  Flexible Apache licensing and zero out of pocket costs isn't
  enough. 
</p>

<p>
  You have to be able to easily understand the code, so you can
  fully exploit, and even change it, as needed.
</p>

<p>
  The library also needs complete docs, a full set of examples,
  on-line demos, and a thorough test set so you don't spend more
  figuring out how to use it than you saved by not having
  to buy it.
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately, GChart's straightforward implementation frees up a
  lot of time that can be devoted towards making the library
  reliable and easy to use.
</p>

</ul>

<p>
These are our principles. We stand by them. Until, of course, we
figure out a better way to implement the darn thing.
